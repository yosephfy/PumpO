# Quick-start Guide

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

First, install all dependencies by running `npm install` in _both_ the main `Updog/` directory and in the `Updog/frontend/` folder.

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run e2e`

Runs all Cypress tests. Requires having already run `npm start` in both frontend and backend.
